@DirtiesContext may be used as a class-level and method-level annotation within the same class. In such scenarios,
the ApplicationContext will be marked as dirty after any such annotated method as well as after the entire class.
If the DirtiesContext.ClassMode is set to AFTER_EACH_TEST_METHOD,
the context will be marked dirty after each test method in the class.
